## Your own tiny-net - no server

MyID syncs encrypted data to the devices in your own tiny blockchain net, which means your data is backup securely and **nobody** can access your data without your private key. 
Your team's devices can also become fault-tolerant nodes of your tiny-net. In the event of device lost, not only the nodes help you have all your password data back but also have the lost data self-destruct. Your data is also recoverable from ransomware damage.
